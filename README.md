# ML for Predicting Future COVID Cases
This research project was done collaboratively as part of the "Machine Learning for Virginia" project in Richard Nguyen's Machine Learning class. 
At the start of the COVID outbreak, we decided that it would be an interesting idea to try and predict future cases.
Results were successul on the surface, but we ended up having to come to terms with many errors inherent in forecasting that made the results difficult to apply.
More details are in the code and the paper.
